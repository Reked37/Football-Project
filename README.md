# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application Project; Flatiron Football League
## By: Derek Truesdale

# Description
    The basis of this project was to build a full stack appliaction from the
    front end and the back end. The goal was to be able to create an API that would be used to persist data to the front end. The API must fill all the criteria of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Along with creating seperate views for each page that could be navigated to via a navigation bar. For the front end, the project uses react to create the web pages and use react router to easily navigate to a new page.

# Installation
    All the libraries that are used are:
        Front-end (npm/yarn):
            1. npm/yarn install
            2. semantic-ui-css
            3. react
            4. react-dom
            5. react-router-dom@6
            6. formik
            7. yup

        Back-end:
            1. pipenv install
            2. Flask
            3. Flask-SQLalchemy
            4. Flask-Migrate
            5. SQLalchemy
            6. Faker (seeding)
            7. Psycop

# Usage
    The home page will be the first page you see when opening the webpage. In the top is the navigation bar which will direct you to other paths. The players page will list all the players in the Flatiron Football League which you can edit the player info with the update button. If the delete button is clicked the player will be deleted from the list.
    The team and coaches web page functions the same as it list all the teams and coaches in the league.
    Lastly, the add page is where a new player, team, or coach can be added into the league. Just fill out the information and hit submit and the new entity will be added to the proper list.
